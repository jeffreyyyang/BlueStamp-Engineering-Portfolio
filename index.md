# 4DOF Smart Robot Mechanical Arm
The 4DOF Mechanical Arm is a controllable arm that consists of 4 servos for movement. The user is able to utilize a wired controller or connect an android phone via bluetooth.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was constructing the physical mecahnical arm and mounting the arduino with the extension board on the base. I first downloaded arduino and plugged in the individual servos in order to ensure that everything was functional. After that, most of the time was dedicated towards making the physical arm. Halfway through I realized that I was using the wrong screws as the 10mm and 12mm were extremely similar. To avoid any issues, I had to unscrew the wrong screws and replace them with the correct ones. When finishing the arm, I also had to loosen some of the screws in order for the servos to move freely. Finally, I plugged a single servo to the board and tested its functionality.
