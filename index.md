# 4DOF Smart Robot Mechanical Arm
The 4DOF Mechanical Arm is a controllable arm that consists of 4 servos for movement. The user is able to utilize a wired controller or connect an android phone via bluetooth.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone was working on how to control my mechanical arm. First I implemented a controller and used arduino code to take  inputs from the controller and output servo movement based on each joystick direction (8 total). After that, I began working on a wireless controller. I was able to get my hands on an android phone and attempted to use a premade app, but it required an older version of android. This led me into making my own app in the MIT App Inventor, where I designed and coded the android app to connect via bluetooth. The bluetooth connection was made possible by the HC-06 module, which was a little finicky to use. This process took many attempts and tests in order to calibrate the controls correctly.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was constructing the physical mechanical arm and mounting the arduino with the extension board on the base. I first downloaded arduino and plugged in the individual servos in order to ensure that everything was functional. After that, most of the time was dedicated towards making the physical arm. Halfway through I realized that I was using the wrong screws as the 10mm and 12mm were extremely similar. To avoid any issues, I had to unscrew the wrong screws and replace them with the correct ones. When finishing the arm, I also had to loosen some of the screws in order for the servos to move freely. Finally, I plugged a single servo to the board and tested its functionality.
